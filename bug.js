The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has fully loaded. This is especially true when working with asynchronous operations.  For example, if you're retrieving data from a collection and immediately try to access a field in the retrieved document, you could encounter an error because the data might still be loading in the background.
