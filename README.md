This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications where asynchronous data retrieval is not properly handled, leading to unexpected errors. The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation where we attempt to access data before it has fully loaded, resulting in an error. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the correct way to handle asynchronous data, using promises or async/await to ensure the data is available before attempting to access it. This prevents errors and ensures smoother operation of your Firebase application.
